### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

I'm Bryant, a dedicated student hailing from Mercu Buana University, where I am immersed in the world of Informatics Engineering. With a passion for technology and its
ever-expanding possibilities, I find myself on an exciting journey towards becoming well-versed in this field. Currently, I am delving into the realm of Data Science, adding another 
layer of knowledge to my skill set. As an enthusiastic learner, I am intrigued by the art of extracting valuable insights from data, which is becoming increasingly vital in shaping 
today's innovations. Mercu Buana University's conducive environment provides me with ample opportunities to not only grasp complex concepts but also apply them creatively. 
Eager to contribute my part to the evolving tech landscape, I am excited to see where this educational path will lead me.
